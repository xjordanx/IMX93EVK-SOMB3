## Validation Of Translated Files
This Altium Designer project, including schematics and PCB document, were validated using original NXP gerber image and drill data with comparison against the generated gerber and drill files from the translated Altium Designer project. Two separate CAMTastic! (.cam) files have been included along with all the gerbers, within the Altium Designer project. Use the CAMtastic panel in Altium Designer to enable just the layers being compared. There are some very slight differences because NXP did make a minor polygon modification from Rev. B to Rev. B-3 for production:
**NXP_Factory_Compare.cam** - This one has all the downloaded NXP gerbers (presumably used in production), alongside gerbers generated from the Altium Designer translated project.
**CircuitHub_Gerbers-Compare.cam** - This contains the factory gerbers, gerbers generated by the Altium Designer project, and gerbers downloaded from CircuitHub as used in a Verification bring-up run.
In both cases: 
* Gerber files ending in .art come from NXP/Cadence Allegro
* Gerber files ending in .pho come from CircuitHub
* Gerber files ending in .g* come from this Altium Designer project.

## Verification Of Translates Files
This exact Altium Designer project, after translation from OrCAD + Allegro v17.4, and after many **MANY** hours of clean-up work, was actually sent to CircuitHub for a 5-unit prototype run. It cost ~$3500 USD to produce 5-boards, fully assembled. As of the time of writing, it is presumed everything on them works, because I am able to:
* Use the [Board Control Utility](https://github.com/nxp-imx/bcu) to monitor Voltages, Currents and Temperature on the SOM.
* Use the [Universal Update Utiltiy](https://github.com/nxp-imx/mfgtools/releases/tag/uuu_1.5.201) to program the [current factory Linux image](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/software/embedded-software/i-mx-software/embedded-linux-for-i-mx-applications-processors:IMXLINUX) onto the board's eMMC flash.
* Boot linux, interact via Debug serial (USB) console, enable the WiFi/BT adapter on the base-board, get an IP address, and login to the board via RSH over WiFi.

I have not yet tested the LVDS display output. However, if the board boots with LPDDR4x, eMMC flash, and the PCIe WiFi working, I trust that the fabricator (through CircuitHub) did well enough on the other high-speed differential pairs.
